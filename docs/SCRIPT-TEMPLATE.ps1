<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Template every IronBlackBox script derives from. Copy it, replace the
    example region, keep the helpers.

.DESCRIPTION
    Carries the shared helpers: console output, elevation check, toolkit root
    validation and creation, the JSONL manifest writer and reader, and tracked
    registry writes with previous-value capture.

    There is no shared module by design (see docs/DESIGN.md section 6) — these
    helpers are copied into each script. When you change one here, the drift
    check in tools/check.ps1 is what catches the copies left behind.

    As shipped, this file is runnable: the example region exercises every
    helper against a self-test registry key, which is how the template itself
    reaches L3 on the lab. Replace that region when deriving a real script.

.PARAMETER Audit
    Default. Strictly read-only. Reports current state and what -Apply would
    change. Writes nothing.

.PARAMETER Apply
    Makes the changes, recording each previous value to the manifest first.

.PARAMETER Rollback
    Restores the previous values recorded by a prior -Apply.

.PARAMETER ToolkitRoot
    Base directory for the manifest and any toolkit-owned output.
    Default C:\ProgramData\IronBlackBox. Validated before use — see
    Assert-SafeToolkitPath.

.PARAMETER RunId
    -Rollback only. The run to roll back. Defaults to the most recent
    rollback-eligible run for this script.

.EXAMPLE
    .\SCRIPT-TEMPLATE.ps1
    Audits the host and reports findings. Changes nothing.

.EXAMPLE
    .\SCRIPT-TEMPLATE.ps1 -Apply
    Applies the changes, recording previous values to the manifest.

.EXAMPLE
    .\SCRIPT-TEMPLATE.ps1 -Rollback
    Restores the previous values from the most recent applicable run.

        host.

        THE TEST IS NOT SEVERITY, IT IS WHETHER A LEVER EXISTS. Is there a switch
        to pass, a file to stage, a second run to make? Then it is a finding and
        it belongs in the exit code: "Sysmon is not installed" clears once an
        operator stages the binary, and "not changed without -Force" clears once
        they pass -Force. Those SHOULD be exit 1 until someone acts.

        A host limit is different in kind. Tamper protection cannot be turned on
        without Intune, and no run of this toolkit will ever report otherwise on a
        host that does not have it. If that raised exit 1, an RMM monitor built
        on this toolkit's documented exit codes would be red on that host
        forever - and a monitor that is always red gets muted, which costs the
        operator every OTHER finding this toolkit would have raised. The steady
        state of a healthy armed fleet has to be 0, or the signal is worthless.

        So a host limit prints as [limit], is counted separately in the result,
        and does not touch the exit code. The information is not hidden; it is
        just not an alarm.

#region Parameter validation -------------------------------------------------

# Value ranges are enforced HERE, not by [ValidateRange]/[ValidateSet]/
# [ValidatePattern]/[ValidateCount] attributes, because a binding-time failure
# never reaches this script: PowerShell rejects the argument and the HOST exits
# 1 - the code docs/DESIGN.md section 3 reserves for "findings", so an RMM
# records drift on a host where nothing ran. Same collision that rules out
# `#Requires -RunAsAdministrator` (see Assert-Elevated). These helpers throw and
# the bottom `catch { exit 2 }` reports it. Three binding failures still exit 1
# and no in-script code can change that - wrong type, unknown parameter,
# ambiguous parameter set; docs/DESIGN.md section 3 carries the measurements and
# the invocation wrapper that closes them.
#
# Call these FIRST in Invoke-Main - before Assert-Elevated, any lock, any host
# access - so a bad argument costs nothing and changes nothing.

        ONLY SUPPLIED ARGUMENTS ARE CHECKED, because that is what the attributes
        did: [Validate*] runs only when a parameter is BOUND. Several parameters
        are legitimately empty when omitted (-Volume, -RemoveExclusionType), so
        checking unconditionally would reject command lines that work today.

        $script:SuppliedParameter is assigned $PSBoundParameters at SCRIPT scope,
        right after Set-StrictMode. It cannot be read from $PSBoundParameters
        here: inside a function that automatic variable holds the FUNCTION's own

        Comparison is in [double]. Every bound this toolkit uses is well below
        2^53, where double is still exact; a larger bound would need decimal.

        PARSED AS INVARIANT TEXT, WITHOUT GROUP SEPARATORS, and measured because
        every other option silently changes the operator's number. With the
        no-provider overload this used before - ambient culture - '2.5' parses as
        TWENTY-FIVE on de-DE. With InvariantCulture and the default styles, '2,5'
        parses as twenty-five instead. NumberStyles::Float with InvariantCulture
        is the only combination that transforms nothing: it REFUSES '2,5' and
        '1 000' and names them in the throw below, and reads '2.5' as two and a
        half everywhere.

        Not digits-only, which would be simpler: -ShadowStoragePercent and the
        disk-headroom fractions take real bounds like 0.01 and 0.90. A locale
        number that survives this parse as the wrong magnitude - de-DE '2.000'
        meaning two thousand, read as 2 - then fails the range check on the next
        line, which is loud. That is the acceptable failure; a silent factor of
        ten is not.

        has no learn.microsoft.com citation for where Windows keeps these
        binaries, so a wrong guess must cost nothing. Sysnative and SysWOW64 are
        candidates as well because System32 is redirected for a 32-bit host
        process, and an RMM launching SysWOW64\powershell.exe is how that
        happens here.

        SYSNATIVE IS TESTED FIRST, and the order is load-bearing. Measured on the
        lab, 2026-09-03: from a 64-bit process %SystemRoot%\Sysnative does not
        exist, so this falls through to System32 unchanged; from a 32-bit process
        all three exist. With System32 first, a 32-bit host was therefore served
        the REDIRECTED SysWOW64 copy of every tool and Sysnative was never
        reached - which made the paragraph above describe something the code could
        not do.

        Falling back to the bare name keeps behaviour identical to PATH
        resolution wherever anchoring cannot be done, so this hardens the normal
        host without turning an unusual layout into a missing tool. Pass
        -RequireAnchored to refuse that fallback.

    # the rest exit 2. But FileShare::Read admits readers and refuses writers, so
    # the second concurrent APPEND was failing at the file instead, one layer
    # below the lock that was shaped to prevent it. Two different scripts run with
    # -Apply simultaneously, five rounds on Server 2019: FOUR of the ten launches
    # exited 2 with "The process cannot access the file ... because it is being
    # used by another process." The manifest itself stayed intact - 361 lines,
    # none unreadable - so the share mode was doing its job. The failure was
    # entirely in giving up on the first try.
    #
    # exit 2 means the script did not do its job, so ~40% of a parallel fleet
    # deployment would silently not harden while reporting an execution error an

        Called before the first write of any -Apply or -Rollback. Two jobs.

        1. Honour the contract in docs/DESIGN.md section 4: "-Apply on an
           unreadable manifest exits 2 and refuses to proceed." That was
           documented but never implemented — -Apply only ever appended and
           never read the file, so it could not detect corruption at all.

        2. Quarantine an unterminated final line BEFORE appending after it.
           This is the defect that mattered most: FileMode::Append writes
           straight onto a torn line that has no trailing newline, producing
           {truncated}{"recordType":"run",...} as one physical line. That line
           is then no longer the last, so Read-Manifest's tolerance no longer
           applies and EVERY later -Rollback dies with "manifest is corrupt" —
           permanently, with every previous value sitting readable on disk and
           unreachable. On a client domain controller that means rollback by
           hand.

        Quarantine rewrites the file, which is the one exception to
        append-only. It is a deliberate repair: the torn bytes are preserved in
        a sibling .torn file, never discarded, and the surviving records are
        rewritten verbatim.

<#
    THE ROLLBACK DOCTRINE. Every restorer in this toolkit implements this, and a
    restorer that does not is a defect.

    A restorer resolves the change THREE ways against the host, not two:

      1. the host holds what this run SET       -> undo it            'restored'
      2. the host holds the recorded PREVIOUS   -> already undone,
         value (or is absent, if the run           or the write never
         created it)                               landed: nothing to do
                                                                     'restored'
      3. the host holds something else          -> a third party has
                                                   been here          'declined'

    Plus a fourth outcome for a change that CANNOT be undone by this toolkit,
    ever - a journal it created and will not delete, an enlargement fsutil
    refuses to shrink, a shadow storage association with no documented removal:

      4. un-undoable by design or by the OS                'declined-permanent'

    WHY CASE 2 EXISTS, measured on the lab. Every restorer used to resolve two
    ways: host equals what the run set, or decline. So the SECOND rollback of a
    run declined everything the FIRST had already restored - "the descriptor no
    longer matches what this run set" about a descriptor the toolkit itself had
    just put back. The run therefore never left the eligible set, and
    Test-VisibilityDrift, which excludes only runs whose rollback COMPLETED,
    reported 29 changes as drifted on a host where every one of them had been
    correctly restored. One un-undoable change poisoned every other change in
    its run, forever. That was defect R-1, and case 2 is what closes it.

    Case 2 also settles the case docs/DESIGN.md section 4 always specified and
    no implementation had: a write that was recorded and never landed - an
    EventLog policy overriding a channel config, say - looks exactly like a
    change already restored, and both mean "leave it alone and count it done".

    RUN STATUS follows from the counts, and Get-RollbackRunStatus is the only
    place that decides it:

      all restored                          -> 'completed'
      any retryable decline, or a failure   -> 'failed'   (stays eligible)
      only permanent declines               -> 'completed-with-permanent-declines'

    Anything starting with 'completed' means the rollback did everything it can
    and the run is finished. Eligibility and drift both test for that prefix,
    never for equality with 'completed'.

function Invoke-AbandonRun {
    <#
        Gives up on rolling back one named run, on the record.

        WHY THIS EXISTS (the review log kept in the development repository, RB-1). Case 3 of the doctrine -
        the host holds neither what the run set nor what it recorded - declines
        as RETRYABLE, on the assumption that whatever changed the value might
        change it back. When the thing that changed it is a LATER run of the same
        script, it never will. Measured on the lab: one run held an
        EnableScriptBlockLogging value matching neither state, declined on every
        single -Rollback, and blocked -Rollback from ever reaching an older run.
        Thirteen of fourteen scripts drained their whole backlog in one rollback;
        that one could not drain at all.

        WHAT IT DOES NOT DO, and this is the part that matters. It does not touch
        the host. It does not pretend the change was undone. It writes a record
        saying an operator decided to stop trying, names every change it is
        giving up on, and says so on the console. The host keeps whatever it
        holds.

        WHAT IT COSTS. Test-VisibilityDrift stops expecting the abandoned
        changes, because the run leaves the eligible set. If one of those changes
        is a setting an attacker switched off, this is the operator choosing not
        to be told about it again. That is a real cost and it is why the run has
        to be named explicitly: -Rollback -AbandonRun <runId>, never a bare
        switch, and never "the most recent one".

        IT ROLLS BACK FIRST. Everything that can still be undone is undone, and
        only what still declines is abandoned. Abandoning a change that would
        have restored cleanly would be the worst version of this feature.

        [Microsoft.Win32.Registry]::LocalMachine follows the calling process's

        powershell.exe. Under WOW64, HKLM\SOFTWARE\... is redirected to
        HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\..., so a hardening write would land in the
        redirected key, have no effect on the machine, and then be CONFIRMED by
        a read-back through the same redirected view — a fleet reported
        compliant while none of it is hardened. Worse, the manifest records the
        unredirected path, so a later -Rollback from a 64-bit host writes the
        previous value into a real key the run never touched.
